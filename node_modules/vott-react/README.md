# vott-react

This repository contains custom React Components designed for the Microsoft Open Source VOTT app (https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT). The components are written in React with Typescript. While the VOTT app uses Redux to manage state, these components do not require it.

The main components are:
- Drag-and-drop tag manager tool
- Scrolling thumbnail viewer

Supporting components, grouped in main component folder, include:
- Asset Preview for loading photo or video
- Tags Input for adding tags to tag manager
- Editor toolbar for choosing selection style

Components may be viewed in a browser using Storybook by cloning the repo and running `npm run storybook`
